                    Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development 
                    Organisation (DRDO).
                    <br><br>
                    In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that 
                    was both designed and produced in India.
                    <br><br>
                    Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that prodused a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname 
                    <strong>"Missile Man".</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Among those successes was Agni, India's first intermediate range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

                    His prominent role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero,
                    although the test caused great concern in the international community.
                    <br><br>

                    as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and widening access to health care and education.
